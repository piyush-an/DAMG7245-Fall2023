### Step 7: Monitor and Update

Streamlit Cloud allows you to monitor your deployed app's usage and performance. You can also easily update your app by pushing changes to your GitHub repository. Streamlit Cloud will automatically rebuild and redeploy your app with the latest changes.

Congratulations! Your Streamlit application is now live on Streamlit Cloud and accessible to a global audience.
