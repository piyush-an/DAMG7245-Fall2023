# Google Cloud

## Introduction

Google Cloud, often referred to as GCP (Google Cloud Platform), is a cutting-edge cloud computing platform and suite of cloud services offered by Google. Designed to meet the diverse needs of individuals, businesses, and organizations, Google Cloud empowers users to harness the power of the cloud for a wide range of applications, from hosting websites to advanced machine learning and data analytics.

With a global network of data centers, Google Cloud provides a robust infrastructure that is not only highly available but also highly secure. It offers a comprehensive set of tools, services, and solutions, enabling users to build, deploy, and manage applications and workloads efficiently and securely.

Google Cloud's services span various domains, including infrastructure, data analytics, machine learning, and developer tools. From virtual machines and cloud storage to Big Data solutions, AI and ML services, and APIs, Google Cloud caters to the needs of both developers and enterprises, delivering the resources required to innovate and succeed in the digital era.

## Top Google Cloud Platform Services

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a wide range of services to cater to various cloud computing needs. Here are some of the top services and categories:

1. **Compute Engine:** Allows you to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud, suitable for various workloads and applications.

2. **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** A managed Kubernetes service that simplifies container orchestration, making it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.

3. **Google App Engine:** A Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering that enables developers to build and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.

4. **Cloud Functions:** A serverless compute platform for running single-purpose, event-driven functions without provisioning or managing servers.

5. **Google Cloud Storage:** Offers scalable and highly available object storage for storing and retrieving any amount of data, including multimedia and data backups.

6. **BigQuery:** A fully-managed, serverless, and highly scalable data warehouse for running super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure.


Now, let's embark on a journey of exploration and discovery as we delve into the rich ecosystem of Google Cloud services and learn how to harness the cloud for your unique needs.


## Prerequisites

Before you can start provisioning a Compute Engine instance on GCP and connecting to VS Code, there are a few prerequisites you need to complete:

### Step 1: Create a Gmail Account for $300 Free Credit on GCP

- To begin your journey with GCP, you'll need a Google account. If you don't have one already, create a new Gmail account. This account will be used to access GCP services.

   **Why do you need a Gmail account?**

   A Gmail account is a prerequisite because Google offers $300 in free credits to new GCP users, giving you the opportunity to explore and experiment with various GCP services at no initial cost.

   **How to create a Gmail account:**

   If you don't have a Gmail account, you can create one by following these steps:

   - Go to [Gmail Sign-Up](https://accounts.google.com/signup).
   - Fill in the required information, including your first and last name, desired email address, and a strong password.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the account creation process.

### Step 2: Create a Google Cloud Platform Account and Set Up Billing

- After creating your Gmail account, the next step is to create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account. GCP provides a wide range of cloud computing services, and you'll use this account to access them.

   **Why do you need a GCP account?**

   A GCP account is essential for provisioning virtual machines and other cloud resources, including Compute Engine instances, which you will use in this guide.

   **How to create a GCP account and set up billing:**

   To create a GCP account and set up billing, follow these steps:

   - Visit the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) website.
   - Click on the "Get Started for Free" or "Console" button to begin the registration process.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the necessary information, such as your business name, contact information, and payment details.

   **Important:** As part of the account setup, you will be required to enter billing information. While you may incur charges based on your usage of GCP services, you can still take advantage of the $300 free credit for initial exploration and learning.

Once you've completed these prerequisites, you're ready to move on to provisioning a Compute Engine instance on GCP and connecting to it using VS Code. Continue to the next sections for detailed instructions.
