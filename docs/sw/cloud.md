# Public Cloud Accounts

In this section, we'll guide you through the process of creating cloud accounts with popular public cloud providers. While you're free to choose any cloud provider, we recommend starting with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for its generous $300 credits for 3 months. We'll also provide information on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

1. **Sign Up for GCP**: Visit the [Google Cloud Platform website](https://cloud.google.com/) and sign up for an account.

2. **$300 Credits**: GCP offers $300 in credits for the first three months, which should be sufficient for this course. Make the most of these credits as you learn cloud computing.

## :material-aws: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

1. **Sign Up for AWS**: Go to the [Amazon Web Services website](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up for an AWS account.

2. **AWS Free Tier**: AWS provides a free tier for 12 months, allowing you to explore various services with certain restrictions on resource types. Take advantage of this opportunity to learn and experiment.

## :material-microsoft-azure: Microsoft Azure

You can also explore Microsoft Azure by signing up on the [Microsoft Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/). While specific offers and credits may vary, Azure provides free trials and various student benefits.

## Pro Tip

    To maximize your cloud credits, consider having one team member create a cloud account at a time. By doing this, you can collectively accumulate up to $900 in credits, which can be highly valuable for your cloud-related projects and coursework.

## Note

    It's important to note that you are responsible for your cloud billing, and the university does not provide any cloud credits. Be mindful of your usage to avoid unexpected charges and ensure responsible cloud computing practices.

Enjoy your cloud computing journey!
