- `git push`: Push changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Pull changes from a remote repository.
- `git status`: Check the status of your repository.
- `git log`: View commit history.

## Getting Started with GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop simplifies common Git and GitHub tasks through a graphical interface. Refer to the official [GitHub Desktop documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) to learn how to use the application effectively.

With a GitHub account and GitHub Desktop installed, you'll be ready to create, manage, and submit your assignments as GitHub repository links.

Happy coding and version control with Git and GitHub!
