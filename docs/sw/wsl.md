# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows

When working on cloud-based projects or needing a Linux-like environment on Windows, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is an excellent solution. It allows you to run a Linux distribution alongside your Windows environment. In this section, you will learn how to install an LTS version of Ubuntu within WSL.

## Install Linux on Windows with WSL

Follow these steps to install Ubuntu on Windows with WSL:

1. **Open Microsoft Store**: Search for "Microsoft Store" in your Windows search bar and open it.

2. **Search for Ubuntu**: In the Microsoft Store, search for "Ubuntu." Look for an LTS (Long Term Support) version of Ubuntu.

3. **Install Ubuntu**: Click on the Ubuntu version you prefer and click the "Install" button. The installation process will begin.

## Setting up Ubuntu in WSL

Once you've installed Ubuntu within WSL, you'll need to perform some initial configuration, including setting a Linux username and password.

1. **Launch Ubuntu**: Open the newly installed Ubuntu app from your Windows Start menu.
